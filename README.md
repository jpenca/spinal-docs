# What is spinal?
spinal is an environment for programming step sequencers - currently it works exclusively with the [Elektron Analog Rytm](http://eu.elektron.se/drum-machines/analog-rytm/) drum computer. The spinal language is designed specifically for dealing with musical events in a step sequencer  grid, and is kept simple in order to maximize user expression.

Spinal currently is being implemented as a Mac application which can interpret the language and translate it into the binary format for storing sequences on the drum machine. it also knows how to communicate with the drum machine.

# Usage
## Setup
you need a Rytm drum computer and a Mac running the spinal environment.
- Connect the Drum machine to your Mac via USB.
- on the Rytm drum computer, make sure that USB-MIDI communication is enabled.
- Disable Overbridge-Mode on the Rytm drum computer.
