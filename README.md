# What is spinal?
spinal is an environment for programming step sequencers - currently it works exclusively with the [Elektron Analog Rytm](http://eu.elektron.se/drum-machines/analog-rytm/) drum computer. The spinal language is designed for dealing with musical events in a step sequencer  grid, and is kept simple in order to maximize user expression.
Spinal is being implemented as a Mac application which interprets the language and communicates with the drum machine.

# Usage
## Setup
you need a Rytm drum computer and a Mac running the spinal environment.
- Connect the Drum machine to your Mac via USB.
- on the Rytm drum computer, make sure that USB-MIDI communication is enabled.
- Disable Overbridge-Mode on the Rytm drum computer.
